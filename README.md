# CPSC 310 Project

UBC is a big place, and involves a large number of people doing a variety of tasks. The goal of this project is to provide a way to perform tasks required to run the university and to enable effective querying of the metadata from around campus. This will involve working with courses, sections, and rooms.

This is a full stack web development project split into four sprints. The first three sprints are server-side development using Node. The fourth sprint is client-side development. The main developement language used throughout is typescript. 

The entire project uses test-driven development technique to build a query engine that enables query of metadata from more than 64000 files over 2 different types of datasets. The software capable of query data ranging from all courses and sections offered at UBC to all building present at UBC.
